We are using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) for generating library, [GRUNT](http://gruntjs.com) for tasks and [Bower](http://bower.io/) for packaging.

make sure you have installed npm. If using *NIX machines you can use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh):
```
brew install npm
```

```
npm install -g generator-lib
```
you can use `npm` to install [GRUNT](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started):

```
Fork the reposotiry then clone your fork of the repository from GitHub and cd into it.
